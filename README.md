# Arbiter Timing Beep

This is a really simple python script made to help to get the timing of the Arbiter Perk right on Decaying Winter - Roblox. All it does is beep three times before a fourth beep that is played almost exactly at the perk timing so it's easier to get it right.

If you don't have Python installed I've included an internet shortcut to python.org and a batch script called "Install Libraries" that automatically installs all the python libs needed to run the scipt.

Also just keep in mind that the script requires admin rights in order to work properly, so feel free to read the code to see if there's anything suspicious.
